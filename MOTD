Welcome to Lethal Ape VR, where the shadows have eyes and the walls whisper secrets you were never meant to hear. Tonight, fear is not just a feeling—it’s a presence. Something lurks beyond your vision, waiting, hunting, and you are not as alone as you think.

This is not just a game. It’s survival. Every sound you make could be your last, every step could lead you deeper into the unknown. Will you run? Will you hide? Or will you stand your ground and face what lurks in the dark?

No matter what path you choose, remember this—Lethal Ape VR is always watching. Stay sharp, trust no one, and whatever you do… don’t look back.
